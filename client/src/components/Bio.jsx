              <h1>My Approach</h1>
              <p className='approach'>
              My approach works with individuals to fully understand their 
              constitution, and any states of imbalances, from an Ayurvedic 
              perspective. From this, I create individualised treatment plans 
              that directly address clientsâ€™ health concerns and goals. Weekly 
              follow up visits enable me to work deeply with individuals to 
              track progress in their treatment, to adjust treatment as necessary 
              and ensure the plan is directly in line with clients goals. I am 
              passionate about empowering individuals with an understanding of 
              their constitution and Ayurvedic approaches to treatment through 
              each step of their journey together.
